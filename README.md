# Managing File Permissions in Linux


## Overview
This project demonstrates my ability to manage file and directory permissions in a Linux environment. The research team at my organization required updates to the `projects` folder to ensure that files and directories had proper access levels for users, groups, and others. The existing permissions did not fully align with the required authorization levels, creating potential security risks.

Through this project, I reviewed current permissions, interpreted the 10-character permission strings, modified access using Linux commands, and ensured that only authorized users had the appropriate privileges. Hidden files and directories were also handled according to organizational standards.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Checking file and directory permissions using `ls -la`
- Interpreting the Linux permissions string
- Modifying permissions with `chmod` for owners, groups, and others
- Managing hidden files and directories
- Applying access control principles to strengthen system security

## Project Artifacts
The repository includes:
- `File_Permissions_in_Linux.pdf`: A complete portfolio document with screenshots, commands, and explanations of all tasks performed.

## How to Use
This project is primarily a **portfolio showcase** and does not contain executable code. The included PDF details all commands used and their effects on file and directory permissions, providing a clear record of applied Linux file management skills.
